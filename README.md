# fMRI_Semantic_Aligment_using_CLIP
The objective of this project is to explore and understand the fMRI dataset from the BOLD5000 project and implement a CLIP-based contrastive tuning approach. The goal is to align the fMRI data (brain activity) with semantic information derived from images. This alignment will allow us to investigate how brain activity patterns correspond to various stimuli, such as images from different datasets (COCO, ImageNet, Scene).
